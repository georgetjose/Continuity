# Continuity

This is a program that launches selenium in the same browser.

Sometimes we require this during debuging when the Test scenario is long and the error pops up in the last step.

This way we can focus on the important part of fixing the issue rather than re-running the entire test again and again till the issue is fixed.

Enjoy!!!!! Star the repo if it was helpful.
